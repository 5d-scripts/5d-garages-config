## UI Translation
The user interface (UI) has already been translated into both German and English for your convenience. To implement these translations, follow these steps:

Navigate to the `/locale` folder.
Choose the pre-translated HTML folder that corresponds to your desired language (German or English).
Copy the chosen HTML folder.
If you prefer the German translation, as the script comes with it by default, you're all set. If you'd rather use the English translation, follow these additional steps:

Go to the `/client` directory.
Paste the copied HTML folder here.
Ensure that you rename the pasted folder to html.
By following these instructions, you'll seamlessly integrate the translated UI into your application, allowing users to interact comfortably in their preferred language.
